GUI Key Concepts and Theories

 Write a 1-2 page paper that critiques the design and stylistic choices you made in your GUI.
Use the “Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design” as the basis for your critique, identifying strengths and potential areas for improvement.
Your write-up must be in a 12-point font with standard margins.
Note: My mentor, Lori Couture said that it would be ok for me to design this interface using Python, rather than Java, but that I should mention in my submission that she had explicitly told me this would be ok. This interface was written using the Python library called Tkinter. 
The “Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design” are: strive for consistency enable frequent ue of shortcuts, offer informative feedback, design dialogue to yield closure, offer simple error handling, permit easy reversal of actions, support internal locust of control, and reduce short term memory load. Because the GUI I designed is an interface for literally nothing, many of these do not apply. Others have been followed to the extent that they are relevant. While this project does not employ classes as required in the project requirements, classes are not necessary to implement: a label, a button, and a toolbar using Python’s Tkinter. The font and font color displayed in the interface can be changed via the toolbar. 

strive for consistency
I think I did a pretty good job of staying consistent. The toolbar is exactly where one who has ever used an application program before would expect to find it. There are three colors and three font sizes. I could have kept up the rule of three, and added a third menu to the toolbar, but had difficulty figuring out how to implement font sizes, and since it was not explicitly listed in the requirements, I choose not to implement it. 

enable frequent use of shortcuts
There was no opportunity for shortcuts as this GUI does not interface any actual program. I could have implemented hot keys to change font and font color, but changes to the interface itself are usually not desired frequently enough to justify the need for hot keys. 

offer informative feedback
The GUI itself informs the user that “This interface does nothing”, so the user likely wouldn’t be surprised that the “print” button does nothing aside from printing “doing nothing…” in the command line. At the very least, printing out this message lets the user know that his mouse click has been acknowledged. 

design dialogue to yield closure
There is no application to give closure to, so this particular rule does not apply to this particular interface. 
offer simple error handling
There is no application so there is also no potential errors, thus no need for error handling. This particular rule does not apply to this particular interface. 

permit easy reversal of actions
The user can change the color or font displayed in the interface. If he so chooses, he can change it back the way that he changed it in the first place. 
support internal locust of control
The interface responds to the user’s commands, and nothing is automated, thus there is nothing to make the user feel that he is not in control. 
reduce short term memory load. 
There is no application and there aren’t multiple pages, so this particular rule does not apply to this particular interface. 
Conclusion
This interface follows the 8 Golden Rules where relevant, but without an application to attach it to, a task that is beyond the scope of this project, many of them are not possible or relevant. I feel that this GUI satisfies all of the requirements of this project though it is written in Python rather than Java.
